      <p>
        Serve Day is a one-day outreach event during which the people of Journey
        Church engage in multiple service projects throughout the south Denver
        area. The vision of Serve Day is for us, the local church, to go into
        our communities and love our neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Journey, our belief is that we are never more like Jesus than when we
        are serving, and together we can make a difference through simple
        gestures of selfless love. Our hope is that peopleâ€™s hearts will be
        opened to the love of Jesus through practical projects and acts of
        service.
