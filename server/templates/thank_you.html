            <p>Dear {{.Name}},</p>
            
            <p><strong>Thank you so much</strong> for making this past Saturday a great day of impact in the Denver area. At Journey, our belief is that we are never more like Jesus than when we are serving, and the difference you made was incredible. <strong>769 people of all ages participated in 46 projects!</strong> So whether you collected items, painted, did yard work, assembled bags and boxes, organized shelves, and so much moreâ€¦ <strong>it mattered</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>As a Journey Church and Serve Day Team, we are deeply grateful.</p>
            
            <p>Now some of you might be thinking, <strong>"What's next?"</strong> I would love to offer 3 steps you can take.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Save The 2026 Serve Day Date.</strong> Next summer, Serve Day will occur on Saturday, July 11. Mark your calendars now and be ready to sign up next year.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Serve at the Christmas Store.</strong> This year will be Journey's 14th Annual Christmas Store. The mission of the Store is to provide dignity to parents and guardians who are struggling by empowering them to be the heroes of Christmas (<a href="http://www.christmasstorecolorado.com">www.christmasstorecolorado.com</a>). The Store will be December 12-13, and volunteer registration will begin on November 9.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Start a Serve Group.</strong> The great thing is that you don't have to just serve on Serve Day, but it can become a normal rhythm in your life. At Journey, we are always looking for people who would love to coordinate a monthly serve group. It could be a group that serves monthly at the same organization, or monthly at different organizations. If God is nudging you, email me back and we can begin making it a reality.</p>
            
            <p>If you could do one more thing for me, would you please forward this email to anyone you signed up as a "guest". Thank you!</p>
            
            <p>Take The Next Step,<br>
